# Performance Considerations for Sheet Tree Processing

## Original Implementation Issues
- Multiple data passes (filesystem -> sheets -> rows -> cells)
- Redundant regex operations on same paths
- Excessive path joining operations
- Nested loops creating O(nÂ³) complexity in worst case

## Optimizations Applied
1. **Single-Pass Processing**
   - Combined sheet/row/cell detection into one loop
   - Reduced complexity to O(n)
   - Uses structured Maps for efficient lookups

2. **Path Processing**
   - Single split operation per path
   - Cached path joins for repeated values
   - Early continues to skip invalid paths

3. **Memory Management**
   - Structured intermediate data
   - Reuse of path strings
   - Minimal temporary object creation

## Potential Further Optimizations
1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Worker threads for large directories
   - Parallel directory scanning

2. **I/O Optimizations**
   - Directory streaming instead of bulk loading
   - Result caching for frequent access

3. **Memory Optimizations**
   - Path string interning
   - Preallocated buffers for known sizes
