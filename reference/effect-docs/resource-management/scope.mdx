In long-running applications, managing resources efficiently is essential, particularly when building large-scale systems. If resources like socket connections, database connections, or file descriptors are not properly managed, it can lead to resource leaks, which degrade application performance and reliability. Effect provides constructs that help ensure resources are properly managed and released, even in cases where exceptions occur.

By ensuring that every time a resource is acquired, there is a corresponding mechanism to release it, Effect simplifies the process of resource management in your application.

## The Scope Data Type

The `Scope` data type is a core construct in Effect for managing resources in a safe and composable way.

A scope represents the lifetime of one or more resources. When the scope is closed, all the resources within it are released, ensuring that no resources are leaked. Scopes also allow the addition of **finalizers**, which define how to release resources.

With the `Scope` data type, you can:

- **Add finalizers**: A finalizer specifies the cleanup logic for a resource.
- **Close the scope**: When the scope is closed, all resources are released, and the finalizers are executed.

**Example** (Managing a Scope)

```ts twoslash
import { Scope, Effect, Console, Exit } from "effect"

const program =
  // create a new scope
  Scope.make().pipe(
    // add finalizer 1
    Effect.tap((scope) =>
      Scope.addFinalizer(scope, Console.log("finalizer 1"))
    ),
    // add finalizer 2
    Effect.tap((scope) =>
      Scope.addFinalizer(scope, Console.log("finalizer 2"))
    ),
    // close the scope
    Effect.andThen((scope) =>
      Scope.close(scope, Exit.succeed("scope closed successfully"))
    )
  )

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
finalizer 2 <-- finalizers are closed in reverse order
finalizer 1
*/
```

In the above example, finalizers are added to the scope, and when the scope is closed, the finalizers are **executed in the reverse order**.

This reverse order is important because it ensures that resources are released in the correct sequence.

For instance, if you acquire a network connection and then access a file on a remote server, the file must be closed before the network connection to avoid errors.

<Aside type="tip" title="High-Level Resource Management">
  Although managing scopes directly with `Scope` is possible, it's more
  common to use higher-level functions like
  [Effect.addFinalizer](#addfinalizer) or
  [Effect.acquireUseRelease](#acquireuserelease), which handle much of the
  complexity for you.
</Aside>

## addFinalizer

The `Effect.addFinalizer` function is a high-level API that allows you to add finalizers to the scope of an effect. A finalizer is a piece of code that is guaranteed to run when the associated scope is closed. The behavior of the finalizer can vary based on the [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/) value, which represents how the scope was closed—whether successfully or with an error.

**Example** (Adding a Finalizer on Success)

<Tabs syncKey="pipe-vs-gen">

<TabItem label="Using Effect.gen">

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

//      ┌─── Effect<string, never, Scope>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer((exit) =>
    Console.log(`Finalizer executed. Exit status: ${exit._tag}`)
  )
  return "some result"
})

// Wrapping the effect in a scope
//
//      ┌─── Effect<string, never, never>
//      ▼
const runnable = Effect.scoped(program)

Effect.runPromiseExit(runnable).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Finalizer executed. Exit status: Success
{ _id: 'Exit', _tag: 'Success', value: 'some result' }
*/
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using pipe">

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

//      ┌─── Effect<string, never, Scope>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.addFinalizer((exit) =>
  Console.log(`Finalizer executed. Exit status: ${exit._tag}`)
).pipe(Effect.andThen(Effect.succeed("some result")))

// Wrapping the effect in a scope
//
//      ┌─── Effect<string, never, never>
//      ▼
const runnable = Effect.scoped(program)

Effect.runPromiseExit(runnable).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Finalizer executed. Exit status: Success
{ _id: 'Exit', _tag: 'Success', value: 'some result' }
*/
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

In this example, we use `Effect.addFinalizer` to add a finalizer that logs the exit state after the scope is closed. The finalizer will execute when the effect finishes, and it will log whether the effect completed successfully or failed.

The type signature:

```ts showLineNumbers=false "Scope"
const program: Effect<string, never, Scope>
```

shows that the workflow requires a `Scope` to run. You can provide this `Scope` using the `Effect.scoped` function, which creates a new scope, runs the effect within it, and ensures the finalizers are executed when the scope is closed.

<Aside type="note" title="Finalizer Execution Order">
  Finalizers are executed in reverse order of how they were added,
  ensuring that resources are released in the proper sequence, just like
  in stack unwinding.

**Example** (Adding a Finalizer on Failure)

//      ┌─── Effect<never, string, Scope>

    Console.log(`Finalizer executed. Exit status: ${exit._tag}`)
  )
  return yield* Effect.fail("Uh oh!")
})

// Wrapping the effect in a scope
//
//      ┌─── Effect<never, string, never>
//      ▼
const runnable = Effect.scoped(program)

Effect.runPromiseExit(runnable).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Finalizer executed. Exit status: Failure
{
  _id: 'Exit',
  _tag: 'Failure',
  cause: { _id: 'Cause', _tag: 'Fail', failure: 'Uh oh!' }
}
*/
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using pipe">

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

//      ┌─── Effect<never, string, Scope>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.addFinalizer((exit) =>
  Console.log(`Finalizer executed. Exit status: ${exit._tag}`)
).pipe(Effect.andThen(Effect.fail("Uh oh!")))

// Wrapping the effect in a scope
//
//      ┌─── Effect<never, string, never>
//      ▼
const runnable = Effect.scoped(program)

Effect.runPromiseExit(runnable).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Finalizer executed. Exit status: Failure
{
  _id: 'Exit',
  _tag: 'Failure',
  cause: { _id: 'Cause', _tag: 'Fail', failure: 'Uh oh!' }
}
*/
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

In this case, the finalizer is executed even when the effect fails. The log output reflects that the finalizer runs after the failure, and it logs the failure details.

This example shows how a finalizer behaves when the effect is interrupted. The finalizer runs after the interruption, and the exit status reflects that the effect was stopped mid-execution.

## Manually Create and Close Scopes

When you're working with multiple scoped resources within a single operation, it's important to understand how their scopes interact.
By default, these scopes are merged into one, but you can have more fine-grained control over when each scope is closed by manually creating and closing them.

Let's start by looking at how scopes are merged by default:

**Example** (Merging Scopes)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

const task1 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("task 1")
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("finalizer after task 1"))
})

const task2 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("task 2")
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("finalizer after task 2"))
})

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // The scopes of both tasks are merged into one
  yield* task1
  yield* task2
})

Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program))
/*
Output:
task 1
task 2
finalizer after task 2
finalizer after task 1
*/
```

In this case, the scopes of `task1` and `task2` are merged into a single scope, and when the program is run, it outputs the tasks and their finalizers in a specific order.

If you want more control over when each scope is closed, you can manually create and close them:

**Example** (Manually Creating and Closing Scopes)

```ts twoslash
import { Console, Effect, Exit, Scope } from "effect"

const task1 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("task 1")
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("finalizer after task 1"))
})

const task2 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("task 2")
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("finalizer after task 2"))
})

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const scope1 = yield* Scope.make()
  const scope2 = yield* Scope.make()

  // Extend the scope of task1 into scope1
  yield* task1.pipe(Scope.extend(scope1))

  // Extend the scope of task2 into scope2
  yield* task2.pipe(Scope.extend(scope2))

  // Manually close scope1 and scope2
  yield* Scope.close(scope1, Exit.void)
  yield* Console.log("doing something else")
  yield* Scope.close(scope2, Exit.void)
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
task 1
task 2
finalizer after task 1
finalizer after scope 1
doing something else
finalizer after task 2
*/
```

In this example, we create two separate scopes, `scope1` and `scope2`, and extend the scope of each task into its respective scope. When you run the program, it outputs the tasks and their finalizers in a different order.

<Aside type="note" title="Extending a Scope">
  The `Scope.extend` function allows you to extend the scope of an effect
  workflow that requires a scope into another scope without closing the
  scope when the workflow finishes executing. This allows you to extend a
  scoped value into a larger scope.
</Aside>

You might wonder what happens when a scope is closed, but a task within that scope hasn't completed yet.
The key point to note is that the scope closing doesn't force the task to be interrupted.

**Example** (Closing a Scope with Pending Tasks)

```ts twoslash
import { Console, Effect, Exit, Scope } from "effect"

const task = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.sleep("1 second")
  console.log("Executed")
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("Task Finalizer"))
})

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const scope = yield* Scope.make()

  // Close the scope immediately
  yield* Scope.close(scope, Exit.void)
  console.log("Scope closed")

  // This task will be executed even if the scope is closed
  yield* task.pipe(Scope.extend(scope))
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
Scope closed
Executed <-- after 1 second
Task Finalizer
*/
```

## Defining Resources

### acquireRelease

The `Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release)` function allows you to define resources that are acquired and safely released when they are no longer needed. This is useful for managing resources such as file handles, database connections, or network sockets.

To use `Effect.acquireRelease`, you need to define three actions:

1. **Acquiring the Resource**: An effect describing the acquisition of the resource, e.g., opening a file or establishing a database connection.
2. **Using the Resource**: An effect describing the actual process to produce a result, e.g., reading from the file or querying the database.
3. **Releasing the Resource**: The clean-up effect that ensures the resource is properly released, e.g., closing the file or the connection.

The acquisition process is **uninterruptible** to ensure that partial resource acquisition doesn't leave your system in an inconsistent state.

The `Effect.acquireRelease` function guarantees that once a resource is successfully acquired, its release step is always executed when the `Scope` is closed.

**Example** (Defining a Simple Resource)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Define an interface for a resource
interface MyResource {
  readonly contents: string
  readonly close: () => Promise<void>
}

// Simulate resource acquisition
const getMyResource = (): Promise<MyResource> =>
  Promise.resolve({
    contents: "lorem ipsum",
    close: () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        console.log("Resource released")
        resolve()
      })
  })

// Define how the resource is acquired
const acquire = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: () =>
    getMyResource().then((res) => {
      console.log("Resource acquired")
      return res
    }),
  catch: () => new Error("getMyResourceError")
})

// Define how the resource is released
const release = (res: MyResource) => Effect.promise(() => res.close())

// Create the resource management workflow
//
//      ┌─── Effect<MyResource, Error, Scope>
//      ▼
const resource = Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release)
```

In the code above, the `Effect.acquireRelease` function creates a resource workflow that requires a `Scope`:

```ts showLineNumbers=false "Scope"
const resource: Effect<MyResource, Error, Scope>
```

This means that the workflow needs a `Scope` to run, and the resource will automatically be released when the scope is closed.

You can now use the resource by chaining operations using `Effect.andThen` or similar functions.

We can continue working with the resource for as long as we want by using `Effect.andThen` or other Effect operators. For example, here's how we can read the contents:

**Example** (Using the Resource)

```ts twoslash collapse={3-34}
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Define an interface for a resource
interface MyResource {
  readonly contents: string
  readonly close: () => Promise<void>
}

// Simulate resource acquisition
const getMyResource = (): Promise<MyResource> =>
  Promise.resolve({
    contents: "lorem ipsum",
    close: () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        console.log("Resource released")
        resolve()
      })
  })

// Define how the resource is acquired
const acquire = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: () =>
    getMyResource().then((res) => {
      console.log("Resource acquired")
      return res
    }),
  catch: () => new Error("getMyResourceError")
})

// Define how the resource is released
const release = (res: MyResource) => Effect.promise(() => res.close())

// Create the resource management workflow
const resource = Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release)

//      ┌─── Effect<void, Error, Scope>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const res = yield* resource
  console.log(`content is ${res.contents}`)
})
```

To ensure proper resource management, the `Scope` should be closed when you're done with the resource. The `Effect.scoped` function handles this for you by creating a `Scope`, running the effect, and then closing the `Scope` when the effect finishes.

**Example** (Providing the `Scope` with `Effect.scoped`)

```ts twoslash collapse={3-34}
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Define an interface for a resource
interface MyResource {
  readonly contents: string
  readonly close: () => Promise<void>
}

// Simulate resource acquisition
const getMyResource = (): Promise<MyResource> =>
  Promise.resolve({
    contents: "lorem ipsum",
    close: () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        console.log("Resource released")
        resolve()
      })
  })

// Define how the resource is acquired
const acquire = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: () =>
    getMyResource().then((res) => {
      console.log("Resource acquired")
      return res
    }),
  catch: () => new Error("getMyResourceError")
})

// Define how the resource is released
const release = (res: MyResource) => Effect.promise(() => res.close())

// Create the resource management workflow
const resource = Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release)

//      ┌─── Effect<void, Error, never>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.scoped(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const res = yield* resource
    console.log(`content is ${res.contents}`)
  })
)

// We now have a workflow that is ready to run
Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Resource acquired
content is lorem ipsum
Resource released
*/
```

### acquireUseRelease

The `Effect.acquireUseRelease` function is a specialized version of the `Effect.acquireRelease` function that simplifies resource management by automatically handling the scoping of resources.

```ts showLineNumbers=false
Effect.acquireUseRelease(acquire, use, release)
```

The main difference is that `Effect.acquireUseRelease` eliminates the need to manually call `Effect.scoped` to manage the resource's scope. It has additional knowledge about when you are done using the resource created with the `acquire` step. This is achieved by providing a `use` argument, which represents the function that operates on the acquired resource. As a result, `Effect.acquireUseRelease` can automatically determine when it should execute the release step.

**Example** (Automatically Managing Resource Lifetime)

```ts twoslash collapse={3-31}
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

// Define an interface for a resource
interface MyResource {
  readonly contents: string
  readonly close: () => Promise<void>
}

// Simulate resource acquisition
const getMyResource = (): Promise<MyResource> =>
  Promise.resolve({
    contents: "lorem ipsum",
    close: () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        console.log("Resource released")
        resolve()
      })
  })

// Define how the resource is acquired
const acquire = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: () =>
    getMyResource().then((res) => {
      console.log("Resource acquired")
      return res
    }),
  catch: () => new Error("getMyResourceError")
})

// Define how the resource is released
const release = (res: MyResource) => Effect.promise(() => res.close())

const use = (res: MyResource) => Console.log(`content is ${res.contents}`)

//      ┌─── Effect<void, Error, never>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.acquireUseRelease(acquire, use, release)

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
Resource acquired
content is lorem ipsum
Resource released
*/
```
