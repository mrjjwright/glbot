**systematic** - a simple way to work with your computer

#### grids

systematic has a base modern css stylesheet hand maintained with css variables that setup a strict grid and subgrid layout.

cols are 4 spaces wide and rows are 1 line high

a `--space` is `1ch` of monospace font

a `--line` is `1.25rem` high or about `20px`

cells are bigger basic visual units that holds value and content

cell are whole multiples of cols and rows, by default 1 col x 1 row in dimension

cells can span multiple columns but only one row and only exist in tiles

a line of cells is simply a sequence of cells

a tile is 5 columns wide and multiple lines high,
all lines past the visible ones are revealed via scrolling

lines and tiles of cells are placed on grids, which are the pages of systematic

we use `grid` instead of page because we want to think of the internet not as a collection of pages but as a collection of atomic cells...

identified by their content

think of content like character, it doesn't matter what you are _called_, it simply matters what you are

these grids are served up as urls and are stored in git, along with the content of the cells

the foundation of systematic is plain content in cells backed by git and run on simple always supported, quick and reliable web tech

#### controller and editor

the ui of **systematic** is oriented towards giving you 2 strong functions to control its objects:

> objects are tiles, lines, or cells

**controller** (top): create and organize tiles, in git, databases and memory, and then play them in sequence. Each tile is made up of multiple lines. tiles can contain lines of other tiles or lines that do stuff.

**editor** (bottom): view and edit the content of selected objects using the built-in Monaco editor, simple rendered forms or a good tool on your computer

the ui is then a simple stacked web based editor that can be anchored to the side of some work product if desired or used standalone in flexible ways

#### why git?

controlling the computer is aided by git and setting up content from your computer to be transformed to new more useful content on your computer

by running some function on it with or without ai in the mix

but if you mess up you always use git to get back to a known good state

you can use ai to condense information to more useful forms

you can store the result in git and rinse and repeat

if you mess up you can go back

you will need code for useful transformations and to run useful computations and processes and programs and effects and uis and all sorts of cool things

you can use the computer to do anything you want especially with help of the internet and ai

but it all starts with content and content is king and must be stored in git

#### tiles <I, O, R>

tiles take optional input, produce optional output, and take in optional requirements (context)

tiles are the basic unit of systematic

tiles compose

tiles are built on Effect, basically a JS generator plus a bunch of TS magic

#### content tiles

a content tile is a tile that holds content of type C as it's output

content tiles store one or more lines of content

each line of a content tile corresponds to one chunk of content saved in a file on your computer or a single value in memory

you don't have to know that exactly but you do need to know that **systematc** is built on a sophisticated database for content

you don't have to know that the name of it is git as we discussed in the last section

you do need to have some intution for what content is

a pdf, an image, a screenshot, a text file, a json or javascript file, a csv file, a video, a sound file, a 3d model, a program, a function, a class, a module

or think of it more as something just more raw and singular

one physcal file | chunk | value | property of content per line

labels can be specified by the user and/or generated by ai based on the content

one cell in each line of the content tile holds the content, the rest hold the optional label

content tiles implmented using json files in git with their values often mapping to actual content in other files in the repo

content tiles when played emit their content as output

#### logic tiles

a logic tile is implemented like most things in **systematic** by a single coherent TS class

each line in the tile contributes logic

logic tiles have input lines, input validation lines, instruction lines, invariant lines, output lines, output validation lines

logic tiles are json files from which typescript code is generated. that code loads the content

logic tiles can be set up as alien-signals computeds and hence become "reactive logic"

logic tiles and run tiles are both similar in that they are essential functional tiles that can run "code".

logic tiles are designed with restraints

logic tiles cannot run "POST" fetches

logic tiles cannot set data/content/values into cells outside them

logic tiles can only read files, not write to them or delete them

logic files can only select from sqlite, not insert, update, or delete

#### basic example

a content tile holds a prompt, a json schema, an example json all to build a little custom JSON editor

a function tile with input as storage tile, and ai model name

first line uses `cat` instruction cell to concatenate all content from lines of content tile

second line calls ai model with name with concatenated prompt

ouput line holds the ai result
