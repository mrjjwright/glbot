**systematic** - a simple way to work with your computer

#### grids

systematic has a base modern css stylesheet hand maintained with css variables that setup a strict grid and subgrid layout.

cols are 4 spaces wide and rows are 1 line high

a `--space` is `1ch` of monospace font

a `--line` is `1.25rem` high or about `20px`

cells are bigger basic visual unit that holds value and content

cell are whole multiples of cols and rows, 1 col x 1 row in dimension

a line of cells is simply a sequence of cells

a tile is a sequence of lines

control tiles are special tiles that are used to build systems and are by default 5 columns wide

tiles are bigger unit of interaction and composition, as you will see later

lines can sequence left to right or up and down and so can tiles, like grid and flex is modern css

lines and tiles of cells are placed on grids, which are the pages of systematic

we use `grid` instead of page because we want to think of the internet not as a collection of pages but as a collection of atomic cells...

identified by their content

think of content like character, it doesn't matter what you are _called_, it simply matters what you are

these grids are served up as urls and are stored in git, along with the content of the cells

the foundation of systematic is plain content in cells backed by git and run on simple always supported, quick and reliable web tech

so grid files are special json files in git that point to cells in other files in the repo

#### controller and editor

the ui of **systematic** is oriented towards giving you 2 strong functions to control its objects:

> objects are tiles, lines, or cells

**controller** (top): control and connect control tiles through: history, storage, content, logic, and actions

**editor** (bottom): view and edit the content of selected objects using the built-in Monaco editor, simple rendered forms or a good tool on your computer

the ui is then a simple stacked web based editor that can be anchored to the side of some work product if desired or used standalone in flexible ways

#### why a controller

controlling the computer is aided by git and setting up content from your computer to be transformed to new more useful content on your computer

by running some function on it with or without ai in the mix

but if you mess up you always use git to get back to a known good state

you can use ai to condense information to more useful forms

you can store the result in git and rinse and repeat

if you mess up you can go back

you will need code for useful transformations and to run useful computations and processes and programs and effects and uis and all sorts of cool things

you can use the computer to do anything you want especially with help of the internet and ai

so the controller is the tool you will use where you setup content that is important to you

#### content tiles

content tiles store one or more lines of content

each line of a content tile corresponds to one file on your computer or a single value in memory

you don't have to know that exactly but you do need to know that **systematc** is built on a sophisticated database for content

you don't have to know that the name of it is git

you do need to have some intution for what content is

a pdf, an image, a screenshot, a text file, a json or javascript file, a csv file, a video, a sound file, a 3d model, a program, a function, a class, a module

or think of it more as something just more raw and singular

one physcal file | chunk | value | property of content per line

labels can be specified by the user and/or generated by ai based on the content

one cell in each line of the content tile holds the content, the rest hold the optional label

content tiles implmented using json files in git with their values often mapping to actual content in other files in the repo

content tiles can be placed in signals and hence becomes reactive content and values

#### logic tiles

a logic tile is implemented like most things in **systematic** by a single coherent TS class

each line in the tile contributes logic

logic tiles have input lines, input validation lines, instruction lines, invariant lines, output lines, output validation lines

logic tiles are json files from which typescript code is generated. that code loads the content

logic tiles can be set up as alien-signals computeds and hence become "reactive logic"

logic tiles and run tiles are both similar in that they are essential functional tiles that can run "code".

logic tiles are designed with restraints

logic tiles cannot run "POST" fetches

logic tiles cannot set data/content/values into cells outside them

logic tiles can only read files, not write to them or delete them

logic files can only select from sqlite, not insert, update, or delete

#### run tile

a run tile is a tile that runs in the real world and can do things like draw on the screen

they do not have the same access restraints as logic tiles

run tiles can write to files or post to apis or insert into databases

run tiles can optionally reactively run in alien-signals effects and keep uis up to date or anything in sync with the real world

quite powerful, in combo with the other powerful primitive tiles

#### runner

the controller is not just a grid of tiles

those tiles don't do anything by default

they should be considered inert

only things in the runner are running

you can run multiple things there in nested ways that correspond roughly to alien-signals scopes and roughly to like nested uis but mostly we will describe a really direct way to control the input and output process

we try to be dumb, like git

the basic idea is that there is this special TS class called RunnerTile, and there is one as the child of the Controller

the RunnerTile renders a tile wide strip down the left hand side of the Controller interface

a pipeline where run tiles can be dragged

it is rather strict because tiles must be strictly sequenced within it and lower tiles can only refer to tiles above them

a logicTile to add needs 2 input cells on it's first line

in normal cases it might not need to run its input and output validation

it has an output

in the runner it needs some kind of run tile to make it actually run

a simple one is print which prints the tile output before it by default

a lot of run tiles operate by default on the tiles above them making them convenient to drop into the Runner tile pipeline

we call it a pipeline but it's a proper alien-signals reactive network as well if need be

reactive pipelines are more complex and live and wait and react so we call them out as "live" tiles

but pipelines can have no alien-signals

they can just be plain JS running as plain JS on the JS event loop

the Runner runes lines ultimately

#### basic example

a content tile holds a prompt, a json schema, an example json all to build a little custom JSON editor

a function tile with input as storage tile, and ai model name

first line uses `cat` instruction cell to concatenate all content from lines of content tile

second line calls ai model with name with concatenated prompt

ouput line holds the ai result
